## 📚 What I Learned Today
Cloud Computing Fundamentals

### Key Concepts

#### 🌥️ What is Cloud Computing  
On-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.  
This model allows organizations and individuals to scale resources quickly and avoid heavy upfront costs.

#### 🧩 Cloud Deployment Models  
- **Cloud-based:** Fully deployed in the cloud.  
- **On-premises:** Traditional in-house data centers.  
- **Hybrid:** Combination of both; suitable for gradual migrations or sensitive workloads.  

#### 💻 Client–Server Model  
Clients send requests and servers process and respond. This model forms the foundation of cloud communication.

#### 🚀 Benefits of AWS  
- Pay-as-you-go model  
- Global reach and scalability  
- Agility and flexibility  
- Cost efficiency  
- No need to manage physical infrastructure  

#### 🌍 AWS Global Infrastructure  
- **Regions:** Geographical areas hosting AWS resources.  
- **Availability Zones (AZs):** Separate data centers within a region for redundancy.  

#### 🔐 AWS Shared Responsibility Model  
| Responsibility Type | Handled By | Example |
|----------------------|------------|----------|
| **Security OF the Cloud** | AWS | Infrastructure, physical hardware |
| **Security IN the Cloud** | Customer | Data, access management, configurations |
| **Shared** | Both | Network controls, patching |
